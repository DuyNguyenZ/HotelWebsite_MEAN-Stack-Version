     <p> &emsp; The first bedroom here, designed by Mauritz Snyman, uses soft and soothing grays and
        silvers to create a sparkling, luxurious feel. From a modern chandelier 
        that dangles over the bed to a plush silvery gray carpet that practically begs for 
        your bare feet, waking up in this bedroom would be like waking up inside a warm storm cloud.</p>
